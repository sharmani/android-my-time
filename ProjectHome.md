Initially I created **My Time** for my own daily use. I tested a large number of time sheets for Android and found no one with the features I needed and simple enough for my liking.
When I showed **My Time** to my friends and they urged me to publish it on Android Market to let them use it too.

There is a [manual](http://code.google.com/p/android-my-time/wiki/Index) and a [discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/group/my-time-for-android), where you can discuss features and issues with me and other **My Time** users.
