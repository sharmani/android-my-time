# My Time Roadmap #

The general idea is to keep this application simple but useful. I use it myself and will add what I need in my daily work. But I hope you can also use it, of course.
As you may need function I don't, I will try to make the application open ended - so that you can add functions without having to change the code of the core application. One way of doing this is to add functions in separate applications that can use the database of My Time. An example is apps for transferring the time information to other systems, or to publish the information for the guy sending out the invoices, for example.


# Functions #

  * Backup/restore of the whole database for safety
  * Transfer to other system (separate function). May be manually started or automatic on change or timed. May even be a bi-directional sync to a database that can be edited on the web, for example.
